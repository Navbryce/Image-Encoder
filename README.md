The tool lets one encode and decode encrypted messages in messages. It was first prototyped in Python and then coded with a GUI using C# and .NET.

The actual message encryption revolves around XOR. Messages are embedded in random LSB.

The Windows app allows one to easily embed messages as well as decrypt them and save the output.
